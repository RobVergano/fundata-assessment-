*Why lof of zero is undefined?*

A logarithm is the power to which a number must be raised in order to get some other number.(1) 

Ex: log 100 = 2

One of the rules with logarithm is that you can never get zero by raising a number to the power of other number. It is not possible to reach zero, you can only approach it using an infinitely large and negative power.(1)

This explains why it is not possible to reach zero in the graphic axes while using a logarithm.
